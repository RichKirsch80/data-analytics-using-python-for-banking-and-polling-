Created main.py; this script will run the analysis for the csv file to return analysis text files for PyBank and PyPoll. Resource folders contain the the CSV files for each project. The analysis folder in each project contains the a text file with their respective breakdown. 

First project PyBank

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
